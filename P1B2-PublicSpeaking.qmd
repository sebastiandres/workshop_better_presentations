What is normal  
- UNIDIRECTIONAL: We minimize how much we control the audience. Raise your hands...
- Narrative: Conflicto, Sorpresa, Preciso (don't be the boring kind)
- Pit of snakes & drawing/practice comic. "you are born with this talents..."
- Jitters, doubts, nervousness. Afraid: sign of a healthy brain.
- Empathy: audience roots for you!
- Emergences: your reaction will be mirrored by the audience. If you keep your cool, people will too.
- Public speaking is different from speaking, just as karaoking is different from sining on the shower. 
- PSp: Willingness to stand out. 
- It's never as bad as you , and never as good as you dream. But it's unpredictable.
- Effective Storytelling >> Easier to remember (speaker and audience), more engaging, more fun, it's deliveratedly created. It's an act!

- Congrats! Huge step towards improving.
- Skill to be improved.
- 

- Presentation is communication
- Humans: biological computers

TO DO:
- Expand content on regular public speaking notes (common advice)  

Storytelling tips/tricks help a long way. Life is boring without emotions.
When no emotion is given, BOREDOM is the emotion.

REGULAR TIPS:
- It's never about you. You are never the protagonist on other peoples' life.
- Always have a structure to guide you - allow for surprises, but don't break the structure. As simple as Jobs 3 examples.

## Presentation is communication

This schema is a simplification. But it really boils down to this.
Someone presents.
Someone receives.
A message is exchanged (almost unidirectionally)
