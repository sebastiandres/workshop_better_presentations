What is normal  
- UNIDIRECTIONAL: We minimize how much we control the audience. Raise your hands...
- Narrative: Conflicto, Sorpresa, Preciso (don't be the boring kind)
- Pit of snakes & drawing/practice comic. "you are born with this talents..."
- Jitters, doubts, nervousness. Afraid: sign of a healthy brain.
- Empathy: audience roots for you!
- Emergences: your reaction will be mirrored by the audience. If you keep your cool, people will too.
- Public speaking is different from speaking, just as karaoking is different from sining on the shower. 
- PSp: Willingness to stand out. 
- It's never as bad as you , and never as good as you dream. But it's unpredictable.
- Effective Storytelling >> Easier to remember (speaker and audience), more engaging, more fun, it's deliveratedly created. It's an act!

- Congrats! Huge step towards improving.
- Skill to be improved.
- 

- Presentation is communication
- Humans: biological computers

TO DO:
- Expand content on regular public speaking notes (common advice)  

Storytelling tips/tricks help a long way. Life is boring without emotions.
When no emotion is given, BOREDOM is the emotion.

REGULAR TIPS:
- It's never about you. You are never the protagonist on other peoples' life.
- Always have a structure to guide you - allow for surprises, but don't break the structure. As simple as Jobs 3 examples.

Same as you do with riding a rollercoaster.

We are only as good as our communication skills.

You are perceived as the multiplication of "how good you are" by "how good you communicate".  
Communication skills end up being the "great filter" for engineers, scientists, and programmers.

##### Confession

Non-verbal communication is my weak point.  

When I ask for feedback, I get the following:

- You should vary the pace
- You should vary the volume

I'm working on it!

#### Last one:

### Be honest and vulnerable
### but never undermine yourself or your work!
