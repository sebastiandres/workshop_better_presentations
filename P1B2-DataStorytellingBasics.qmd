Stories are

:::
:::

:::{.notes}
People have been telling stories since the begining, because it's just the way our brains work. 
[click]
It's a "built-in technology" because it allows for knowledge transmission. 
It allows collective learning and cooperation at small and large scale.

Stories are not a random collection of facts. There's a very specific order: start, conflict, conflict resolution, ending. 
That's the pattern that the brain craves, because it can learn from it. That's why we consume so much stories in any form: books, comics, tv-series, movies, etcetera.
So, what do you do when you know how something works? You hack it, of course!

The peak-end rule is a fun fact. You remember something for:
What was the most intense emotion
How it ended
You can use this to build your presentation around the big ending you want. 
If you are not convinced, let me give you a real example.

We, collectively, enjoyed 7 seasons of this great tv series. Can you guess wich one it is?
[click]
Yes, the whole game of thrones series is remembered by the not-so-great ending and the peak scenes (do you remember the red wedding?)

We are only as good as our communication skills. If you’re really really good, but cannot articulate your ideas and communicate effectively, you’ll only be as good as someone bad but with great communication skills.

Presentations that will change something on your audience.

AI can also be a good source of inspiration and help when making better presentations.
It's really helpful to create images to complement your talk and illustrate your points. Use it to get ideas, analogies, examples, or event prompts to create better images. You can use AI to get your first draft very fast, and iterate from there.
Think of AI as the friend that gives you some good and bad ideas. It's your responsability to select the good ones! For every image I put on the presentation, there are 10, 20 or more that I did not use!

* Other: canvas, revealjs, prezi

This relates to presenting software because the classic powerpoint software is not very helpful to share code. 
To be honest, I fine tune my presentations till the last minute - inserting code screenshots is not fun! There are better ways.

:::{.notes}
Quarto is a project from POSIT - they are actually on one of the booths, go get some stickers! You create a plain markdown, so the files and repos are clean and easy to maintain. You can create pretty much anything: Books, websites, and presentations. It’s quite incredible. This presentation has been made in quarto, BTW. For presentations, the markdown file is rendered into a html page with the revealjs library. It’s just a html webpage, so you can share it around and people should be able to open it without to much trouble - or convert it to pdf.

:::{.notes}
So here on the left I have the code that produces the slides on the right.
As you can see, it's just a plain file.
It starts with a configuration part, and lots of other options are possible.
You get the table of contents for free (if you want it!)
You can even do incremental slides or reveal by fragments.
You have to compile/render before the presentation, so little changes of getting errors during the presentation.
But - it cannot do realtime code execution. It's not design for.

[Jupyter + RISE]{style="font-size: 1em; color: gray"}

<img style="width:100%;" src="./images/rise/basic_usage.gif">

:::{.notes}
You click on the "launch slideshow" button, and a dynamic presentation is created on the fly. Same as quarto, it uses the revealjs javascript library as backend, but it can execute python code (or your kernel's language) on the fly. This is very useful if you are running a tutorial or something that needs that kind of interactivity.

<img style="width:100%;" src="./images/streamlit/pyconchile2021.gif">

:::{.notes}
Sometimes it just makes sense. I did a presentation on PyCon Chile 2021 about Streamlit, and it felt natural to explain the library using the library to create the presentation. It made sense, as I could show the code and execute the code, without having to go back and forth between a presentation and a terminal. The main point is, again, Show dont tell. On presentations about code, don't tell me how to use it, show me how to use it!
:::
---

## A decision flow
::: { .incremental }

* PowerPoint: Single use no-code presentation
* Quarto: Talks from related documents (books, articles)
* Jupyter + RISE: Workshops or classes. Executing code is important
* Streamlit: Customized/experimental presentations
:::

:::{.notes}
My decision flow to choose a presentation sofware goes as:
[click]
PowerPoint: Single use no-code presentation. When I have no time. 
[click]
Quarto: Talks from related documents (books, articles) - but no need to execute code!
[click]
Jupyter + RISE: Workshops or classes. Executing code is important.
[click]
Streamlit: Customized/experimental presentations. 
Nevertheless, I still follow the data storytelling principles. It's just the software that it changes. I have to confess, my slides are kind of my babies. I spent too much time on them, tweaking, changing small details only I will notice, learning how to push the software a bit beyond limits. I think people can notice when you put love into something.
