Key content:
- Why Data Storytelling? (Practical Storytelling)
- 5 Data Storytelling Principles
- You cant tell people what to feel. Make them feel it, make it obvious.
- You cant tell people what to think. Make a crumb path for them to get to the discovery. (Example: X means Y. (people reacts to it). I'm from Y, and I have experienced X. So I think if Y, then X.)
- Make people work for their meal. "Ikea effect!"
- Don't make yourself replaceable. You "dance" with your presentation. It's a complement.
- Stories are inevitable, but not predictable. Just like life. You don't know what will happen, but when it happens, it makes sense. 
- You can't tell all stories at the same time. Pick one hero, one villain. 1 perspective. (This links to visualization) 
- Objective of all stories is change. Something changes, irrevocably. A story without change is dull, is a "semblanza", a description. 
- Practical Storytelling is not putting memes on your slide deck. Dont be the meme guy. Avoid common places - reuse them smartly.

Endings are the most important part of the story (and the presentation).

The ending is what gets remembered. It should tie everything together.

Work on your final slides - don't leave it to change. Skip the middle slides if needed, never the last ones.

[5 Data Storytelling Principles]{style="font-size: 60px; margin: 0px"} <br>
:::

---

## Principle #1

[Always raise the stakes!]{.fragment}

[Never give away the ending!]{.fragment}

[This is called **"creating a narrative debt"**]{.fragment}

---

## Hansel and Gretel {.incremental}

[FONT SIZE]

- **Main Problem**: Food scarsity at home
  - **Problem 1**: Father wants to leave H&G at forest
    - Solution: Use breadcrumbs to mark the road
    - Problem: Birds eat breadcrumbs and they get lost
  - **Problem 2**: H&G get lost.
    - Solution: Arrive to a house
    - Problem: They get captured by witch
  - **Problem 3**: Witch wants to eat them
    - Solution: Use chicken finget to trick the witch.
    - Problem: She is suspicious
  - **Problem 4**: She wants to put them in the oven
    - Solution: Push Witch in oven.
- **Solution**: Return with witchs gold.

---

## Principle #2

[Details are important, but not all details are important.]{.fragment}

[Keep only the essential.]{.fragment}

[This is called **"The Chekhov's Gun"**]{.fragment}

---

This manifests in:

- Less text
- Rounding numbers
- Simpler graphs
- Analogies and metaphors

---

[Don't try to look smart by using fancy words.]{.fragment}  

[Smart people are those who can explain complex ideas in simple ways, not who knows more jargon.]{.fragment}


---

## Principle #3

[People like better when they participate on the process.]{.fragment}

[Make people work for their meal (but never too much).]{.fragment}

[This is called **"The IKEA effect"**.]{.fragment}

---

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
<br><br>
People don't like to be spoonfed nor ignored.  

Leave enough breadcrumbs for people to follow and anticipate the story/solution, without revealing the ending.
:::
::: {.column width="35%"}

Your first draft is always going to be terrible.

* Use AI chatbots for: 
  * Analogies and examples

* Don't search for images, create them!

## Principle #5

[Show]{style="color: green"}, [don't tell.]{style="color: red"}

::: {.incremental}
- Don't say "this is the best": show why it's be the best.
- Don't say the code is clean: show the code.

## [Show]{style="color: green"}, [don't tell]{style="color: red"} for engineers

### Tell:

```
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. sep, end, file, and flush, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.

All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end. Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end.

The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings, print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these, use file.write(...) instead.

Output buffering is usually determined by file. However, if flush is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the flush keyword argument.
```

## [Show]{style="color: green"}, [don't tell]{style="color: red"} for engineers

### Show:
Documentation:
```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
```

Executable code:
```{pyodide-python}
print("Hello", "lovely", "people", sep="\n") # Try: "", " ", "üá®üáø", ...

## The framework

Brandon Sanderson's storytelling framework:  

* **Promise**: [What is the story about?]{.fragment .fragment-index-1}
* **Progress**: [Is the story advancing towards the promise?]{.fragment .fragment-index-2}
* **Payoff**: [Did you fulfill or break the promise?]{.fragment .fragment-index-3}

[Payoff != Ending.]{.fragment}  

[Payoff is how satisfactory is the ending of the story.  
Was the effort worth it?]{.fragment}

---

## Example: Star Wars IV

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/P1B3/poster_a_new_hope.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::
::: {.column width="80%"}
* **Promise**: [Rebels fight back against the Empire.]{.fragment .fragment-index-1}
* **Progress**: [Luke develops his skills as a Jedi.]{.fragment .fragment-index-2}
* **Payoff**: [The death star explodes!]{.fragment .fragment-index-3}
:::
:::

---

## Example: Jurassic Park I

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/P1B3/poster_jurassic_park.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::
::: {.column width="80%"}
* **Promise**: [Accidents in a park with dinosaurs.]{.fragment .fragment-index-1}
* **Progress**: [Accidents get progressively worse.]{.fragment .fragment-index-2}
* **Payoff**: [Protagonists survive but dinasaurs overrun the park.]{.fragment .fragment-index-3}
:::
:::

---

## Example: 

Let's apply it to any story or presentation!

* **Promise**: 
* **Progress**: 
* **Payoff**:

Some ideas: The Lord of the Rings, The Name of the Wind, Ring World, ...

---

## How does this applies to data and slides?

## 

Same data, two plots:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
![](images/dst_before.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
![](images/dst_after.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

. . .

Don't share numbers. Share a story.
