Key content:
- Why Data Storytelling? (Practical Storytelling)
- 5 Data Storytelling Principles
- You cant tell people what to feel. Make them feel it, make it obvious.
- You cant tell people what to think. Make a crumb path for them to get to the discovery. (Example: X means Y. (people reacts to it). I'm from Y, and I have experienced X. So I think if Y, then X.)
- Make people work for their meal. "Ikea effect!"
- Don't make yourself replaceable. You "dance" with your presentation. It's a complement.
- Stories are inevitable, but not predictable. Just like life. You don't know what will happen, but when it happens, it makes sense. 
- You can't tell all stories at the same time. Pick one hero, one villain. 1 perspective. (This links to visualization) 
- Objective of all stories is change. Something changes, irrevocably. A story without change is dull, is a "semblanza", a description. 
- Practical Storytelling is not putting memes on your slide deck. Dont be the meme guy. Avoid common places - reuse them smartly.

Endings are the most important part of the story (and the presentation).

The ending is what gets remembered. It should tie everything together.

Work on your final slides - don't leave it to change. Skip the middle slides if needed, never the last ones.

[5 Data Storytelling Principles]{style="font-size: 60px; margin: 0px"} <br>
:::

---

## Principle #1

[Always raise the stakes!]{.fragment}

[Never give away the ending!]{.fragment}

[This is called "Narrative debt"]{.fragment}

---

Examples of narrative debt:

...

---

## Principle #2

[Details are important, but not all details are important.]{.fragment}

[Simple is always better.]{.fragment}

[Don't try to look smart by using fancy words and too many details.  
Smart people are those who can explain complex ideas in simple ways, not who knows more jargon]{.fragment}

---

This manifests in two ways:

- Less text
- Simpler graphs
- Analogies and metaphors: break down complex ideas into simpler ones

---

## Principle #3

Breadcrumbs / IKEA effect

Make people work for their meal, but never too much. 

---

IKEA effect: we love more things we have put effort into.

Breadcrumbs: people don't like to be spoonfed nor ignored. Something in the middle.

---

## Principle #4

Your first draft is always going to be terrible.

  * Analogies and examples
  * Prompts to create better images!
* Don't search for images, create them!

## Principle #5

[Show]{style="color: green"}, [don't tell.]{style="color: red"}


[
- Dont say "this is the best": show why it could be the best.
- Dont say the code is clean: show the code.
]{.fragment}

## [Show]{style="color: green"}, [don't tell.]{style="color: red"}

[Guido's eyes lit up as the terminal finally executed without errors. A wide grin spread across his face. He jumped up from his chair, fists raised in triumph. "Yes!" he exclaimed, as he savored the moment of triumph with a deep, contented sigh.]{style="color: green"}

## The framework

Brandon Sanderson's storytelling framework:  

* **Promise**: [What is the story about?]{.fragment .fragment-index-1}
* **Progress**: [Is the story advancing towards the promise?]{.fragment .fragment-index-2}
* **Payoff**: [Did you fulfill or break the promise?]{.fragment .fragment-index-3}

Payoff != Ending.
Payoff is how satisfactory is the ending of the story.

---

## Example: Star Wars IV

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/P1B3/poster_a_new_hope.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::
::: {.column width="80%"}
* **Promise**: [Rebels fight back against the Empire.]{.fragment .fragment-index-1}
* **Progress**: [Luke develops his skills as a Jedi.]{.fragment .fragment-index-2}
* **Payoff**: [The death star explodes!]{.fragment .fragment-index-3}
:::
:::

---

## Example: Jurassic Park I

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/P1B3/poster_jurassic_park.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::
::: {.column width="80%"}
* **Promise**: [Accidents in a park with dinosaurs.]{.fragment .fragment-index-1}
* **Progress**: [Accidents get progressively worse.]{.fragment .fragment-index-2}
* **Payoff**: [Protagonists survive but dinasaurs overrun the park.]{.fragment .fragment-index-3}

## How does this applies to data and slides?

---

## 

Same data, two plots:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
![](images/dst_before.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
![](images/dst_after.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

. . .

Don't share numbers. Share a story.
