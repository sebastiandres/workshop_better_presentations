## A canvas model

## Activity
Guidelines:

* I'll give you 3 presentation scenarios. 

* Choose one (or make up your own) and apply the framework to it. 

* Work in pairs, discuss and complete the canvas. Add as much details as you can imagine.

## Choose your adventure: Presentation #1

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* You are a Senior Data Scientist, delivering a talk about the findings of project **Kabutops** to a room of C-level executives.
* Duration: 15 minutes
* Observations: You know you'll get interrupted constantly by the CEO.

## Choose your adventure: Presentation #2

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* You are a Systems Architect, explaining the new visualization software **Articuno** to a room of Data Scientists collegues.
* Duration: 15 minutes
* Observations: The Data Scientists are not convinced by the benefits of Articuno, which was imposed by the CTO.

## Choose your adventure: Presentation #3

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* You are a Pythonista, presenting the library **porygon** on a Python Conference to a room of Pythonistas.
* Duration: 20 minutes
* Observations: It's a new python library, without large traction yet but with a lot of potential.

## Sidenote #1

I like to think a presentation as a **problem to be solved**.

How can I best deliver the message, knowing that I have:  

- A specific audience
- Some given time
- A message to deliver

The canvas allows me to structure my thinking and iterate on it.

---

## Sidenote #2

It's easy-peasy lemon squeezy to get (free) images generated by AI, as I just did.  

But it's not so easy to create good images.

## My take on AI

Delegate aggressively on AI, but keep the control wheel.  
Take decisions based on quality. Iterate frequently.
