## Activity 1: The judging hat

What went wrong?

---

## What went wrong?

* Poor structure
* Poor content
* Poor slides
* Poor delivery

---

## What can we learn from this? {.fragment}

- You already have a taste for good presentations. 
- Usually it's enough to "be brave" and "trust your instincts"
- We will develop a framework to guide how to craft better presentations.

## Presentation is communication

![](images/P1B1/ppt_schema.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
This schema is a simplification. But it really boils down to this.
Someone presents.
Someone receives.
A message is exchanged (almost unidirectionally)

##### Presentation is communication
### The human speaker

Humans: old hardware running updated and very demanding software

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
Good news:

- Presenting is a skill that can be learned.
:::
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
Bad news:  

- Being nervous while presenting: part of a healthy brain.

##### Presentation is communication
### The human audience

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
Good news (for the presenter):

- Audience wants you to succeed.
- Brains are easy to hack.
:::
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
Bad news (for the presenter):  

- Audience is easily distracted.

##### Presentation is communication
### The message

Message should be tailored [**to the specific audience**]{.fragment}

[Data Storytelling helps selecting the best **content** and **format** to make the message clear and engaging]{.fragment}

---

## Data Storytelling

My definition:

Tricks and tools to deliver better (data) presentations.

##### Presentation is communication
### Non verbal communication

There's more than just content:
