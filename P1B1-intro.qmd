Change from (800, 600) for 4x3 or (1245, 700) for 16x9
Key points:
- Workshop not talks
- Workshop structure
- Data Storytelling: how we will approach the workshop
- About me
- Workshop materials
- Activity 1: The judging hat
- Next:
  - Part 1 - Block 2: Public Speaking

TODO:
- Select the content for the BAD presentation.
- Create the slides for the BAD presentation.
- Pass to 2 columns (why we make presentations, what types of presentations)
- Create 3 columns for the workshop structure
- Add numbers to the workshop figure
- Improve the graph of "my story in 4 graphics"
- MAY BE USE THE shape of Chile in some graph...
- Name your favorite story (book-movie-game). 
- Why do we spend so much time & money to consume stories? brains are adicted to it, just like chocolate cake! It just tickles the right nerves.
- Stories are sticky. Stories move us. Stories are easy to remember (more than facts, more than numbers, more than rules) -> Pnemotecnics tricks are memorization rules that are based on stories (images).
- We like to be entertained, we like to laugh, to be moved. We like some change (grow).


Programación en Python:
Habilidad común y transferible a varias industrias.
En transformación por avances de Inteligencia Artificial.

Data Storytelling:
Habilidad  poco usual y transferible a varias industrias.
Indiferente a avances de Inteligencia Artificial.

Python + Data Storytelling = Combo Ganador

Data Storytelling work because stories, language, is the natural medium for humans.
