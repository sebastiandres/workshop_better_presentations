##  Title

Python and storytelling to the rescue: Tools, Tips, and Tricks to create and deliver better presentations

## Description

Transform your presentations with Python! In this hands-on tutorial, attendees will learn tools, tricks, and libraries to create impactful presentations for public speaking or teaching. Starting with a bad presentation, we'll learn and apply storytelling, visuals, and technical tools to turn it into a memorable presentation.

## Audience

Just starting out

## Format

This tutorial is structured as a hands-on workshop designed for active engagement. Following the “workshop survival guide” approach, we will switch learning strategies every 15 minutes to maintain attention and reinforce concepts. About half the time is spent on lectures to deliver key insights, with the rest dedicated to participatory activities, including group discussions, hands-on exercises, "judging hat" evaluations, and scenario challenges. This blend ensures that attendees not only grasp theoretical concepts but also practice and apply them to real-world examples. Our goal is to leave participants equipped with actionable tools and techniques to craft and deliver outstanding presentations.

## Outline

The tutorial is designed as an interactive, hands-on learning experience, equipping attendees with practical tools and skills to craft better presentations. Using a poorly designed presentation as a case study, participants will learn and apply step by step practical knowledge to transform it into an outstanding, memorable presentation.
